question: |
  Welcome to the Environmental Justice Screening Form
subquestion: |
  According to 301 CMR 11.05(4), if one or more Environmental Justice “EJ” Populations are located around the Project, you must provide public notice to affected Populations. 

  What is the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act Office “MEPA” review process? 
  
  This is the public review of potential environmental impacts of projects that may require state agency action.
  
  The goal is for state agencies to review the impact of projects and use best efforts to avoid, minimize, and reduce damage to the environment. To the extent damage to the environment cannot be avoided, state agencies will work with you to minimize and reduce damage to the environment to the maximum extent practicable.
